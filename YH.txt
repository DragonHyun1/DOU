=== Hardware-Timed VOLTAGE Collection (with Compression) ===
Channels: ['ai0', 'ai1', 'ai2', 'ai3', 'ai4', 'ai5']
Sampling rate: 30000.0 Hz (30kHz like other tool)
Duration: 10.0 seconds
Raw samples: 300000 (300k)
Compress ratio: 30:1
Final samples: 10000 (after compression)
Mode: VOLTAGE measurement (external shunt)
Adding VOLTAGE channel: Dev1/ai0 (VBAT)
  ⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL failed: DIFFERENTIAL, falling back to RSE
  ⚠️ WARNING: RSE mode will measure Rail voltage, not Shunt drop!
Adding VOLTAGE channel: Dev1/ai1 (VDD_1P8_AP)
  ⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL failed: DIFFERENTIAL, falling back to RSE
  ⚠️ WARNING: RSE mode will measure Rail voltage, not Shunt drop!
Adding VOLTAGE channel: Dev1/ai2 (VDD_MLDO_2P0)
  ⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL failed: DIFFERENTIAL, falling back to RSE
  ⚠️ WARNING: RSE mode will measure Rail voltage, not Shunt drop!
Adding VOLTAGE channel: Dev1/ai3 (VDD_WIFI_1P0)
  ⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL failed: DIFFERENTIAL, falling back to RSE
  ⚠️ WARNING: RSE mode will measure Rail voltage, not Shunt drop!
Adding VOLTAGE channel: Dev1/ai4 (VDD_1P2_AP_WIFI)
  ⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL failed: DIFFERENTIAL, falling back to RSE
  ⚠️ WARNING: RSE mode will measure Rail voltage, not Shunt drop!
Adding VOLTAGE channel: Dev1/ai5 (VDD_1P35_WIFIPMU)
  ⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL failed: DIFFERENTIAL, falling back to RSE
  ⚠️ WARNING: RSE mode will measure Rail voltage, not Shunt drop!
