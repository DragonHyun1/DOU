# Cursor Rules

## File Modification Rules

### Protected Files
- **YH.txt**: This is a personal file used by the user. DO NOT modify, edit, or delete this file under any circumstances. DO NOT read this file.

## Git Workflow Rules

### DEV Branch Workflow
- **Always work on DEV branch**: Never create separate branches or work on other branches
- **Auto-push after completion**: When task is completed, ALWAYS push changes to origin/DEV
- **Push command**: `git push origin DEV`
- **Handle conflicts**: If push is rejected, pull with rebase first: `git pull --rebase origin DEV`

## General Guidelines
- Always respect protected files and directories
- When making changes, avoid touching personal configuration files
- Complete all work and push to DEV branch before finishing
